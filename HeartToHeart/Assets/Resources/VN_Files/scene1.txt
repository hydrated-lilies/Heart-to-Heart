[Character] Aria [EXPR] Silly [POSE] Down
[Line] You're safe! I promise.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Frown [POSE] Open

[Character] Aria [EXPR] Confused
[Line] Has there been somethin' on your mind?
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Worried [POSE] Point
[Line] If you want to talk about it, of course.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Confused [POSE] Down
[Character] Wesley
[Line] Well... it's uh.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Smile [POSE] Hold
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Worried
[Line] It's... pretty dumb, honestly.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Surprise [POSE] Point
[Line] No such thing as a dumb thing to be worried about!
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Happy [POSE] Open
[Line] If something bothers you, then it just does!
[Line] You can't fault yourself on that. That's just unfair to you.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Frown
[Line] I suppose that's true...
[Line] It's... 
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Worried
[Line] I got invited out for drinks with a few coworkers tonight.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Worried[POSE] Closed
[Line] A-And I'm happy about that! But I don't usually go out with new people. It makes me itchy and I never know what to say and I end up making a fool out of myself and-
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Frown
[Line] S-Stuff like that, eheh. 
[Line] I'm just a bit... worried
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Surprise [POSE] Closed
[Line] Hmm, that's certainly an understandable thing to be nervous about.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Happy [POSE] Open
[Line] But hey!! Sounds like your coworkers already enjoy your presence enough to invite you out!
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Happy [POSE] Down
[Line] I'd say you're already doing a wonderful job!
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Frown [POSE] Hold
[Line] Maybe...
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Surprise [POSE] Point
[Line] Where are you getting drinks at?
[Character] Wesley
[Line] I believe it's on 4th and Madrigal Avenue?
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Happy [POSE] Open
[Line] Ah! I know that place!
[Line] They have a few old arcade cabinets in there I love to play.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Smile [POSE] Open
[Line] Oh, really?
[Line] I used to play a lot of Munch Man when I was younger.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Silly [POSE] Point
[Line] Me too! That's the cabinet they have as well!
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Silly [POSE] Down
[Line] Ahh... so nolstalgic...
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Wink [POSE] Down
[Line] And my high score is in the hundreds.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Frown
[Line] Just the hundreds?
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Confused [POSE] Closed
[Line] Is that... not a lot?
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Smile
[Line] I think I remember having something in the thousands.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Surprise
[Line] Seriously??
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Regret [POSE] Down
[Line] I see...
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Silly [POSE] Down
[Line] Didn't realize I was in the presence of a gaming legend!
[Character] Wesley
[Line] A-Ahaha, I'm not sure about that.
[Character] Wesley [EXPR] Smile [POSE] Closed
[Line] I do know a few good strategies, though.
[Character] Aria [EXPR] Happy [POSE] Down
[Line] I'll have to hear some of those, then sometime! Brush up on my own skills
